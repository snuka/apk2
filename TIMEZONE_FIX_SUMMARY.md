# Timezone Fix Summary

## Issue
When booking a calendar event at a specific time (e.g., 11am PST), the event would appear correctly in the calendar app, but when querying for the event through the voice assistant, it would report an incorrect time (e.g., 6pm instead of 11am).

## Root Cause
Google Calendar API returns event times in UTC format (e.g., "2025-06-14T18:00:00Z" for 11am PST). The `formatDateForVoice` function was formatting these UTC times without considering the timezone, causing it to display the raw UTC hour instead of converting to PST.

## Solution
1. Updated `formatDateForVoice` function in `utils/dateTimeParser.js` to accept a timezone parameter (defaults to 'America/Los_Angeles')
2. Updated all calls to `formatDateForVoice` in `tools/calendarTools.js` to explicitly pass 'America/Los_Angeles' as the timezone
3. This ensures all dates are properly converted from UTC to PST before being formatted for voice responses

## Verification
The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- UTC time 2025-06-14T18:00:00Z (6pm UTC) now correctly displays as "Saturday, June 14, 2025 at 11:00 AM" (11am PST)
- UTC time 2025-06-15T01:00:00Z (1am UTC) now correctly displays as "Saturday, June 14, 2025 at 6:00 PM" (6pm PST previous day)

## Files Modified
- `utils/dateTimeParser.js` - Added timezone parameter to formatDateForVoice function
- `tools/calendarTools.js` - Updated all formatDateForVoice calls to include timezone

## Test Script
Run `node test-timezone-fix.js` to verify the fix is working correctly.
