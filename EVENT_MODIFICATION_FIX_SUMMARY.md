# Event Modification Fix Summary

## Issue
The AI assistant was unable to modify (update/delete) existing calendar events, even though creation and listing worked properly.

## Root Cause
The AI agent lacked specific instructions on how to:
1. Extract event names from modification requests
2. Properly format searchQuery parameters
3. Handle the AI-first pattern for event modifications

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Instructions (server.js)
Added detailed section "MODIFYING EXISTING EVENTS - CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS" that teaches the AI:

- **For Updates**: Extract clean event names and convert time changes to ISO format
  - "change my cooking class to 2pm" → searchQuery: "cooking class"
  - "move the meeting to tomorrow" → searchQuery: "meeting"

- **For Deletes**: Extract just the event name
  - "cancel my cooking class" → searchQuery: "cooking class"
  - "remove the dentist appointment" → searchQuery: "dentist"

- **Context Usage**: How to leverage previously listed events
  - "that meeting" → uses context from last listCalendarEvents

### 2. Improved Event Search (calendarService.js)
Enhanced `findEventByTitle` function:
- Extended search window: 30 days past to 90 days future (was 7 to 30)
- Added multi-stage matching:
  1. Exact match
  2. Contains match
  3. Partial word matching
- Better handling of edge cases

### 3. Examples Added
Provided concrete examples in AI instructions:
```
User: "Change my cooking class to 3pm tomorrow"
AI calls updateCalendarEvent with:
  searchQuery: "cooking class"
  updates: { startDateTime: "2025-06-15T15:00:00-07:00", ... }
```

## Testing Approach
Created test scripts to verify:
- Tool structure and invocation methods
- Direct calendar service functionality
- Event modification workflow

## Key Principle: AI-First Pattern Maintained
- Tools continue to expect structured data only
- AI handles ALL natural language processing
- No changes to tool interfaces - only improved AI guidance

## Result
The AI assistant now properly:
1. Understands how to extract event identifiers from natural language
2. Calls the correct tools with properly formatted parameters
3. Handles various phrasings for modifications
4. Uses context when appropriate

## Deployment
These changes are ready to be committed and deployed to Railway.
